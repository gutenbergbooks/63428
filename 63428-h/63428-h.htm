<p>With the view of testing Dr. Draper's
results, I carefully iodized two silver plates
and exposed them to light. I then placed
them so that half of one plate was covered
by half of the other, and allowed them
to remain in the dark 1-24th of an inch
apart for four hours. On mercurialization
I could not detect the slightest difference
between the covered and uncovered portions
of either of the plates.</p>

<p>Another silver plate was iodized and exposed
to light. It was then placed in the
dark wish a sensitive plate which had been
carefully kept from the light, 1-16th of an
inch above it, and a small engraving placed
between them. They were allowed to remain
thus for six hours. When exposed to
the vapor of mercury, the plate which had
been subjected to the light whitened all
over, and the space occupied by the engraving
was distinctly marked by lines of vapor
thicker than the other parts. The plate
which had been preserved in the dark was
scarcely at all influenced by the vapor, except
on those parts which had been touched
by the supports of card-board on which
it rested. These were so arranged that no
radiation could have influenced those parts
of the plates.</p>

<p>An iodized silver plate was placed in the
dark with a little fine string coiled over
parts of it, and a polished silver plate supported
1-8th of an inch above it. After
four hours both plates were subjected to
mercurial vapor. On the iodized plate the
deposit of vapor was uniform, although
slight; but on the superposed plate of silver
a strong and beautiful image of the
string on the under plate became visible. I
found that neither of the two iodized plates
had lost their sensitiveness by the operations
to which they had been subjected in
the dark.</p>

<p>Hoping to detect some evidence of the
process by which these singular results
were produced, I instituted a series of experiments,
of which the following are
some of the most interesting results.</p>

<p>A. A silver plate was iodized, a piece of
card was placed upon it, and a well-polished
mercurial plate (amalgamated copper)
was suspended 1-8th of an inch above it,
and left in this state for a night. The
space on the silver plate corresponding with
the mercurial plate, except under the card,
was nearly freed of its iodine, which had
evidently combined with the mercury on
the upper plate. On exposing the mercurial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
plate to the vapor of mercury the image
of the card was rendered visible, the
vapor covering every part of the plate
except that opposite the card. The silver
plate received the vapor only on those parts
which were not influenced by the mercurial
plate. The upper plate was suspended by
strings; these were faithfully imaged on
both plates; by a thick line of mercurial
vapor on the under plate, by the absence
of it in the upper one.</p>

<p>B. An iodized <i>silvered</i> plate was exposed
to light until brown, and a mercurial plate
suspended above it for twelve hours. The
browned silver plate was <i>whitened</i>, and all
the irregularities of the mercurial plate
strikingly marked on it: the mercurial
plate was slightly tarnished. On rubbing
the silvered plate it was found that the silver
was removed more readily over the
whitened portion, but had lost none of its
adhesion in other parts.</p>

<p>C. Over an iodized silver plate, plates of
gold, platina, silver, brass, copper, copper
amalgamated, and zinc were placed at the
distance of 1-8th of an inch. After three
hours the amalgamated plate had made a decidedly
visible impression on the silver one.
On exposure to vapor, the mercury lodged
on every part of the plate except that affected
by the mercurial plate; some irregularities
were observed, but none which could be
decidedly traced to the other metals in juxtaposition.
I have some evidence that different
metals near each other seriously interfere
with each other's influence.</p>

<p>D. A mercurial plate was iodized, and
another mercurial plate placed 1-8th of an
inch above it. The upper plate became
covered with a bright yellow film; and on
exposing them to mercurial vapor, marks
became apparent which corresponded with
those in the opposite plate.</p>

<p>E. A silver plate was iodized and placed
in the dark with an engraving, face down,
upon it. An amalgamated copper plate
was laid on this, and left for fifteen hours.
The mercurial plate was reddened, and on
exposure to the vapor of mercury, a very
nice impression of the engraving was
brought out, it having been effected through
the thickness of the paper. On the silvered
plate the space covered by the paper was
well marked; but vaporization produced
no trace of the engraving. The space beyond
the paper was rendered white. It
was curious that both plates had several
spots which corresponded, particularly two,
distinguished by a well-defined circle and a
comet-like appendage, in length ten times
the diameter of the circle. These spots
could not be traced to anything visible
in the print or either of the plates, and
must, I think, be referred to some electrical
influence. I find it indeed commonly
the case, that the plates, after being subjected
to these kind of experiments a few
times, become mottled, or present on their
polished faces all the appearances of a
finely-grained wood, and in this state they
are less susceptible of receiving any impression
than when not so.</p>

<p>F. A silver plate was iodized and placed
upon an engraving laid on a brightly polished
mercurial plate, and left in the dark
for twenty-four hours. The mercurial plate
was turned brown, and the silver plate was
left in the same state as if it had been exposed
to sunshine, being <i>brown and black</i>.
Neither of these plates gave a copy of the
picture.</p>

<p>G. A mercurial plate was iodized, and
above it was placed a plate of polished
iron, a disc of paper being first laid on the
mercurial plate, and they were left in this
state for some hours. On exposing the iron
plate to mercurial vapor, it was abundantly
lodged over that space opposite the paper
disc, but not at all on the other parts. The
mercurial plate was attacked by vapor over
every part but that which the paper disc
protected.</p>

<p>Lead and zinc plates were used instead
of the iron one, with nearly similar results.</p>

<p>H. A Daguerreotype was taken, and
without removing the iodine a mercurial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
plate was placed a little above it, and left
for ten hours. When removed, well-defined
traces of the Daguerreotype picture were
evident on the mercurial plate, which leads
me to hope that by careful manipulation we
may succeed in multiplying these beautiful
productions by an easy method.</p>

<p>I became desirous of ascertaining whether
the mercurial plates would produce any
change upon the precipitated iodide of silver.
I find by many experiments, that if
the iodide of silver is pure, no more change
is produced than is produced upon it by
diffused light; but if it is rendered sensitive
by a trace of the nitrate of silver, it is
then darkened as by solar influence.</p>

<p>Sensitive iodide of silver being placed
upon a plate of glass, a mercurial plate
was fixed 1-8th of an inch above it. In
three days the iodide of silver had become
a deep brown, almost a black, and the mercurial
plate was covered with the yellow
iodide of mercury. Nitric acid dissolved
the dark portion of the silver salt, as did
also ammonia, on which was formed Faraday's oxide of silver, thereby proving the
change, either by a primary or a secondary
process, of the iodide into the oxide of
silver. This experiment has been repeated
at least a dozen times, and always with
the same results. If a little heap of the
iodide of silver is placed under a mercurial
plate, it is exceedingly interesting to witness
the gradual formation of the very
beautiful colored rings on the mercury in
the progress of its conversion into an iodide.
By prolonged action the yellow iodide
passes into the bright red biniodide of mercury.
I have some experiments now in
hand, which convince me that similar
chemical changes are to be effected through
considerable spaces. I have succeeded in
decomposing the iodide of copper and the
iodide of gold by mercurial plates placed
nearly a quarter of an inch above them.</p>

<p>I have an extensive record of results similar
to those I have now detailed, all of
them showing that the changes brought
about by this mysterious agent, whether it
be heat, light, or an undiscovered element,
cannot be referred to those rays which the
admirable researches of Sir John Herschel
have shown to be the operative ones in
producing the photographic phenomena
which have so interested the world by their
novel beauty, and which professor Draper
includes within his general term&mdash;tithonicity.
With regard to the detithonizing influence
of the gases mentioned by Dr. Draper
in his paper in your March number, I
can only consider the results, which I find
to be as he has stated, as the simple reconversion
of the decomposed iodide of silver
into another definite chemical compound.
An iodized plate is exposed to light, the
iodide of silver or other sensitive salt is decomposed,
and in a state to receive mercurial
vapor. It is now passed through an
atmosphere of iodine, of chlorine, of bromine,
or of nitrous gas. Chemists are well
aware of the surprising energy with which
these bodies attack the metals, consequently
the exposure of a moment is quite sufficient
to convert the surface which has undergone
a change, into an iodide, chloride, bromite,
or nitrite of silver. I certainly cannot see
the necessity of going so far out of our
way for an explanation of this effect as Dr.
Draper has done.</p>

<p class="caption4">FORMED BY IODINE, BROMINE, AND CHLORINE<br />
UPON VARIOUS METALS.</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p class="caption4">BY AUGUSTUS WALLER, M. D.</p>

<hr class="r10" />


<p>In a paper presented by me to the Academy
of Sciences of Paris, an extract from
which may be seen in the <i>Comptes Rendus</i>
for October 5, 1840, I first demonstrated
the error committed in ascribing to the iodide
of silver alone the power of fixing the
vapors of mercury, after it had been exposed
to the action of light. Instead of this
property being exclusively confined to a
film of iodide of silver, as obtained in the
process of M. Daguerre, I found that it existed
in many other substances when presented
to the action of light in the state of
thin films, viz. by the bromide and chloride
of silver; by the oxide, bromide, iodide and
chloride of copper, and some others; all
these, however, possessing less sensibility
than the iodide of silver of Daguerre, and
therefore less available for the reproduction
of the images of the camera than the compound
originally discovered by that gentleman.
The iodide of Daguerre was found
already too little sensitive to the influence
of light in this climate, especially when
applied to the reproduction of the image of
animate objects, so that those films discovered
by me seemed still less suitable to be
employed for that purpose; this objection
has, however, been completely removed by
recent improvements, more particularly
those of M. Claudet, who effected this
principally by combining the original discovery
of Daguerre with those mentioned
above as having been subsequently made
by myself. Pursuing the first stage of
Daguerre's process, he obtained the film
of iodide of silver, and added to this another
film of bromide, either in a simple state,&mdash;as practised in my experiments published
more than six months before&mdash;or after two
of these substances had been combined together, as the chloride of iodine and the
bromide of iodine, which he was the first
to employ.</p>

<p>These colored films, however, merit attention
independently of the purposes to
which they may be applied in photography: the beauty of some of the phenomena
themselves is peculiarly attractive; the
numerous changes of color they undergo,
either by a variation in the thickness of the
film, or by the action of light, assign them
a place among the most curious facts of
science, and the extreme facility with
which they are obtained adds to the interest
they excite.</p>

<p>Impressed with these ideas, I was induced
to pursue a train of investigation on this
subject; among the results of which, one
of the most interesting was a new method
of making colored rings, like those generally
known under the name of "Newton's colored
rings," on many of the metals, by the
same chemical process as that employed for
forming the films of uniform thickness in
photography. In order to procure these
colored rings, and at the same time to show
the identity of the origin of the colors with
those of the ordinary transparent films, that
is, as residing simply in the thickness of the
lamina and not dependent on the ordinary
cause of color, we have but to place a piece
of iodine on a well-polished surface of silver
or copper, and in a short time we find
around the iodine a series of colored zones
of the various tints of the spectrum, and approaching
in a greater or less degree to the
form of a circle, according as they have
been more or less disturbed in their formation
by currents of the surrounding air. In
order that they may be perfectly regular, as
large as possible, and with tints undisturbed
by the action of light, it is necessary to
place a piece of iodine in the centre of a
well-polished plate, as before described;
this is then to be shaded by an opake
screen superimposed a few lines from the
surface to cause the vapors which would
otherwise ascend and partially escape, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
expand over its silver surface. Colored rings
may be formed in the same manner by bromine
and chlorine and the various combinations
of these bodies with each other,
except that for those that are gaseous or
liquid it is requisite to pay a little attention
to the manner of disengaging them on the
surface of the metal, either by passing
them through a glass tube, or by some other
contrivance easy to execute.</p>

<p>These rings correspond to those formed
by reflected light in Newton's experiments,
with this difference, however, that in the
colored films of the soap bubble, and in
those formed by the glass lenses, the thinest
film is in the centre; whilst in these
rings, obtained by chemical action, it exists
at the circumference, as is the case with
the colored rings of Nobili. In watching
the formation of these phenomena, at first
are seen two or three very small circles,
which appear almost as soon as the iodine
and the metal are placed in contact with
each other; as the experiment continues,
the circumference of these circles become
gradually greater; whilst the external colors
extend themselves over a great space,
those of the centre grow fainter; red and
green now only remain visible, and these
at last, when the film has attained a certain
thickness, in their turn also give place to a
dull coating of brown.</p>

<p>The formation of these rings evidently
depends on the vaporization of the iodine
from the solid nucleus. The variety in
color and extent of these zones is caused by
the difference between the strength of the
vapor at the centre and the circumference
of the iodic atmosphere whilst expanding
over so large a surface. In the metal thus
combining with the vapor, we have to consider,&mdash;1, the force of the vapor of different
distances from the centre; 2, the obstacle
which a film of iodine, once formed, opposes
to any further action between the iodine
and the metal.</p>

<p>This experiment may be varied in different ways:
two pieces of iodine of about
the same size, placed at a small distance
from each other on a silver plate, form separate
colored circles, until these come in
contact at their circumferences, when the
two systems will slowly coalesce and produce
one common outline of the form of an
ellipsis.</p>

<p>As the colors formed on various metals
by the above-mentioned agents are very
similar to one another, it may be sufficient
to examine in particular those produced on
silver by iodine.</p>

<p>The external film of the iodide of silver
rings, which corresponds to the central
black spot in those of Newton, is completely
invisible, it being impossible to perceive
any difference between the parts so covered
and those where the metal is intact; but by
exposing half the plate to the influence of
light, whilst the other part remains covered,
the silver is then found darkened far beyond
the limits of the external gold-colored zone,
where previously the surface was perfectly
clear. The dark film thus rendered apparent
is now liable to be rubbed off by the
slightest friction, whereas before it was
very adherent to the subjacent surface. The
first zone is of a pale gold color, which assumes
a deeper tint as the thickness of the
film increases: the second zone is blue, the
third white: after these appear the different
colors of the spectrum in regular succession,
as in the films studied by Newton
and others, viz. yellow, orange, red, blue
green, yellow &amp;c.</p>

<p>The presence of the golden-colored zone
in the place mentioned is worthy of remark,
as in the tables of Newton of the
colors presented by films of various thicknesses,
the blue is stated as immediately
following the black. The same gold film
is the first which appears on most metals
when their surface is attacked in this manner.
Chlorine and bromine on silver; oxygen
on steel; chlorine and bromine on titanium,
bismuth, &amp;c., commence their colors
in the same way. Copper, however, is
in one respect an exception, this metal first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
becoming of a dark red, which increases to
a ruddy brown and then changes into blue.
This deviation is fully accounted for by the
color of the copper itself. With this single
particularity, this metal undergoes the same
alterations as the others.</p>

<p>The action of light on the different colors
of the iodide of silver is very interesting:
the most correct way of studying this is to
protect one half of a system of colored
rings by an opake screen, while the other
half is exposed for a short time to the influence
of the solar rays. The golden zone
undergoes the greatest change; at first it
grows darker, then red, and at length is
converted into a beautiful green. The blue
film, which comes next in thickness, suffers
considerable alteration in its tint, assuming
a much deeper and more brilliant shade;
the rest of the colors appear to be similarly
affected by the action of light, though to a
very slight degree, acquiring a trifling accession
in their brilliancy. It has already
been remarked that light destroys the adherence
of the external invisible film; the
same thing obtains with the second or gold-colored film,
which turns green, <i>but only to
a certain depth</i> of the film, as may be proved
by slightly rubbing the part thus altered;
the green color is then seen to disappear,
and beneath the pulverulent portion thus
removed is found the gold color, having almost
the same appearance as before the
plate had been exposed. As this experiment
may be repeated several times with
the same results, it shows to how inconceivably
small a depth the light has acted to
produce this effect.</p>

<p>To ascertain what would take place on
augmenting the thickness of the portion
turned green, and the adherence of which
was destroy ed, a piece of iodine was placed
on the plate so that its vapor, by expanding,
might arrive upon the green, at the
same time the whole being kept from the
light; the result was that the additional
film combined with the one already existing, producing
a blue, being the color which
would have resulted by the combination of
the unaltered yellow films. I have found
no chemical substance possessing the power
of arresting, or in any way influencing
these changes of color; strong adds, provided
they do not attack the silver&mdash;for
then, of course, the experiment would be
destroyed,&mdash;and alkalies in concentrated solution,
allow the action of light to go on as
usual. The hyposulphate of soda, and
ammonia in solution have no longer the
power of dissolving the green film as they
had before the action of light.</p>

<p>When the plate is left still longer exposed,
after the changes above stated have taken
place, the colors become more faint,
and within the zone of green a white cloudy
film is caused by the light, which, as it increases,
veils the spectral colors beneath.</p>

<p>The knowledge we at present possess in
chemistry of the affinities with which different
bodies are endowed for combining
with each other is but very imperfect, and
the causes which complicate most chemical
phenomena are so numerous, that it is
scarcely possible to compare any two chemical
actions to each other. Most of the
facts upon which chemical science is founded,
are acquired either by bringing the two
bodies destined to act on each other into
contact by dissolving them in a liquid, or by
subjecting them to a temperature more or
less elevated.</p>

<p>In the first of these methods, we are so
far from being able to calculate the force of
the chemical powers called into play, that
Berthollet was induced to deny the existence
of chemical power in the various phenomena
of solution and precipitation of saline
substances, and according to him what is
called insolubility in a body is merely the
result of its strength of cohesion, an entirely physical property.</p>

<p>When the intervention of caloric is required,
the effects are still more complicated,
as they vary according to the intensity
of the heat employed, and the time its action
is exerted; besides, the chemical action,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
when it does take place, is frequently so instantaneous
that it is impossible in our
present state of science to imagine any
means by which it might be measured. In
the combination of the three bodies, iodine,
bromine and chlorine, with the metals,
however, most of these objections cease to
exist, or may be easily avoided. As their
vapors combine with the metallic surfaces
at the ordinary temperature, they are all of
them in the same circumstances in that respect;
and if the temperature should be required
more elevated, the gasiform state of
these substances, iodine not excepted, enables
us to submit the metals to be experimented
upon all at the same time to the
same influence. If, therefore, it were possible
to reduce the metallic substances into
fine powders the particles of which were
of the same dimensions, by acting upon
them with either of these vapors, an idea
might be formed of the affinities which
produce their binary compounds by the increased
weight acquired by the powders in
this process; but the difference which exists
in the physical properties of the various
metals would preclude the possibility of
any near approach to accuracy in this mode
of proceeding; but by acting on the polished
metallic surfaces, as in the preceding experiments,
all the advantages offered by
the process with the powders are included,
whilst several of the difficulties are removed.</p>

<p>As the film of the compound augments,
it undergoes the various changes of color
which take place in all transparent films,
thus affording a means of ascertaining the
absolute thickness obtained in different circumstances,
when it would be difficult to detect
the slightest difference in weight by
means of the most delicate balance. The
depth of this coating may be ascertained
when either the index of refraction of the
compound itself is known, or if the angle of
polarized light is given by means of the law
discovered by Sir David Brewster, between
the tangent of the angle of polarization,
and the index of refraction. The most
convenient way which occurred to me
of performing these experiments, was the
employment of a bell-glass within which
some iodine is fixed at the top; this apparatus
being placed over the metal to be acted
on, the experiment may be watched in
all its progress, and the action can be retarded
or accelerated at pleasure by varying
the interval of the iodine from the metal,
or by interposing at some distance from its
surface a disc of paper so as to cause the
vapors of iodine to pass through it. Bromine
may be made use of likewise by pouring
a few drops of it over some carded cotton,
and using it in a similar manner with
the iodine. In respect to chlorine, it is
most convenient to disengage it slowly by
dropping a little sulphuric acid upon some
chlorinated lime.</p>

<p>In illustration of the objects of this mode
of experimenting, I will aduce some of the
results it has given me with various metals.
Some of the experiments below were performed
before I had the idea of watching
the progress of the combination through a
transparent medium; they are therefore
less exact than they might otherwise have
been: but I have preferred stating them as
I had inserted them in my note-book before
I had conceived any idea as to their probable
utility in the elucidation of chemical
affinity, and when I intended them for other
purposes, which I shall hereafter explain.</p>

these two substances merely cause a dirty
white appearance on the surface of the
latter. Their combining affinity appears
to be considerable, for when exposed together
with silver the action produced with
both was red at the edges, little altered in
color; on the rest of its surface a dull
white film, in the midst of which were

of that salt.</p>

<p>Until we know the index of refraction of
the different films enumerated, it would be
impossible to give a correct table of the
combining powers in the experiments that
have been detailed; nor is the table of the
relative thickness of transparent plates as
it has been transmitted to us by Newton,
sufficient in the present instance, if any
great degree of precision be required. Besides
these objections, it is necessary before
leaving this subject to pass in review several
others inseparable from the mode of
performing the experiments themselves.
The principal circumstances complicating
these experiments and liable to vary in different
observations, are,&mdash;</p>

<p>First, the hardness of the metal acted
upon; 2ndly, the obstacle opposed to the
continuation of chemical action by the inert
film formed upon the metal; 3rdly, the
force of the vapors that attack the metal.
The influence of the texture of the metallic
surface on chemical action is most evident
when bismuth is the metal employed.
Here the chemical action may be seen to
commence on small isolated portions of the
surface, which have already assumed a
deep gold color, before other parts are in
the least changed, from the natural appearance
of the metal. To determine how far
this might influence the formation of the
iodide of silver, a silver coin was exposed
to iodine with a piece of pure silver; as
the former was so much the harder of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
two, it was naturally supposed that the
chemical action would be slower in exerting
itself on it than on the latter. This,
however, was not the case, as may be seen
by the following statement of the result of
the experiment:</p>

<div class="ind2em">
  Silver coin&mdash;pale gold color.<br />
  Pure silver&mdash;pale gold.<br />

  Pure silver&mdash;yellow, no red apparent.<br />
</div>

<p>The intensity of the resistance offered by
the different films of iodide of silver to a
continuation of the chemical combination,
may be determined by noting the moment
at which the various spectral tints make
their appearance.</p>

<p>By comparing the thickness of the colors
with the space of time required for their
production, it will be found, however imperfect
the table given by Newton may be
when applied to this subject, that towards
the end of the experiment above given, the
chemical combination is retarded by the
presence of the inert film, and that to obtain
the same thickness of film as at the
commencement, about double the time is
required.</p>

<p>The third cause of error may be avoided
by operating with vapors of about the same
force. In those described, the average time
employed in passing to the maximum was
generally about half an hour; if that were
not taken into consideration, different results
might be obtained.</p>

<p>In regard to chlorine, there exists another
cause of complication&mdash;the affinity which
it possesses for water; for when disengaged
in the ordinary manner, chlorine
carries with it a certain quantity of water
which may very much alter the results of
the experiment.&mdash;<i>Philosophical Magazine,</i>

<h2><a name="THE_AMERICAN_ELECTRIC_TELEGRAPH" id="THE_AMERICAN_ELECTRIC_TELEGRAPH">THE AMERICAN ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.</a></h2>


<p>In each of the countries of Europe where
the Electric Telegraph is established, viz.:
Britain, France, Germany, and Russ a, the
people seem anxious to claim for one or more
of their own countrymen some merit in
connection with the invention. The English
speak of Wheatstone and Bain; the
French of Le Sage; the Germans of Steinheil
and Siemen; and the Russians of
Schilling or Jacobi. Most of these inventors
have their agents or representatives in
different countries, ready on every suitable
occasion to speak or write in behalf of their
principal.</p>

<p>The inventor of the American Electric
Telegraph has, we believe, no agent in Europe;
and no person there who has any
special interest in promoting the introduction
of his system. The adoption of it by
the Prussian government for great distances,
as decidedly the best which it could obtain,
after advertising extensively in Europe, is,
therefore, the more remarkable; and especially,
as the only knowledge which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Prussians possess of the American system
seems to have been derived from one imperfectly
acquainted with its powers; for
we can account in no other way for the fact
that Siemen's needle apparatus is adopted
for short distances; Morse's instruments
being clearly superior to Siemen's, or to
any other needle apparatus, for short as
Well as for long distances; since they are
much more rapid in their motion, and have,
besides, the advantage of making a permanent
record on paper, instead of merely indicating
to the eye by an evanescent sign.
No one using the telegraph in America,
would think of employing a needle apparatus
in any of its operations.</p>

<p>In addition to the evidence of the high
estimation of the American Telegraph by
Europeans, furnished by this adoption of it
in Prussia, we learn also from an elaborate
work on Telegraphs by Dr. H. Schellen,
recently published in Dusseldorf, that it is
now introduced into other countries on that
continent. Dr. S. says: "Of late the Morse
Telegraphs are much used in Europe, viz:
in England; between Hamburg and Cuxhaven; between Bremen and
Bremer-haven; in Prussia, Austria, Bavaria and Hanover." Dr. S.
might have added also that
it is used in Turkey. Among the advantages
of the American Telegraph, Dr. S.
says, is its "quickness in making and
marking the signs upon paper. * * * <i>It
records under the hand of a skilful operator
100 to 120 letters, in the same time in
which the best needle telegraphs are able to
indicate 20.</i>"</p>

<p>While the superiority of the American
Electric Telegraph to all others is thus acknowledged
by Europeans, they do not seem
to be aware that the date of the American
invention is also prior in point of time to
that of any of their own electric telegraphs.
They very naturally regard the date of the
patent as the date of the invention, because
in every country in Europe the patent is
given to the person who first promulgates
the invention in that country; and it is not
safe, therefore, in Europe, for an inventor
to permit others to know any thing of his
invention until he has patented it. But in
America, where the law permits no one to
take out a patent but the inventor, he is
perfectly safe in communicating the knowledge
of what he has done, and even in
publicly exhibiting his invention, before he
takes out his patent, provided he secures
himself by a caveat, and does not offer it
for sale, or permit it to go into common use.</p>

<p>The inventor of the American Electric
Telegraph, it is well known, exhibited his
instruments in operation in the N. Y. University,
in the presence of hundreds of our
citizens in September, 1837, and privately
to his friends at various times as far back
as November 1835, although his first patent
was not secured until 1838. No one claims
for the inventions of either Wheatstone or
Steinheil a date prior to 1837; and when
European writers on the telegraph come to
understand our laws, and the error into
which they have fallen, by confounding the
date of the American invention with the
patent, they will no doubt do our country
the justice to admit its claims to priority as
well as to <i>superiority</i>.&mdash;<i>N. Y. Observer.</i></p>

4 francs by 100 kilogrammes in England,

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> give the following as copied at the
Patent Office in London. Many of our
Daguerreotypists have enquired of us in
relation to the patents on the Daguerreotype
in England.</p>

<div class="hanging1">
<span class="smcap">To Autoine Jean Claudet</span>, of High Holborn, in the county of Middlesex, glass
merchant, for an invention of improvements
in the process and means of obtaining
the representation of objects of nature
and art,&mdash;being a communication.<br />
[Sealed 21st November, 1843.]
</div>

<p>These improvements consist in rendering
the Daguerreotype picture susceptible of
producing, by printing, a great number of
proofs or copies; thereby transforming it
into a complete engraved plate.</p>

<p>The process is established on the following
facts, which have come to the knowledge
of the inventor:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. A mixed acid, composed of water,
nitric acid, nitrate of potassa, and common
salt, in certain proportions, being poured
upon a Daguerreotype picture, attacks the
pure silver, forming a chloride of that
metal, and does not effect the white parts,
which are produced by the mercury; but
this action does not continue long. Then,
by a treatment with ammonia (ammonia
containing already chloride of silver in solution,
is preferable for this operation), the
chloride of silver is dissolved, and washed
off, and the metal being again in its naked
state, or cleansed from the chloride, it can
be attacked afresh by the same acid. This
acid acts better warm than cold.</p>

<p>2d. As all metallic surfaces are soon
covered (when exposed to the atmosphere)
with greasy or resinous matters, it is necessary,
in order that the action of the acid
upon the pure silver should have its full
effect, for the surface to be perfectly purified;
this is effected by the employment of
alcohol and caustic potash.</p>

<p>3d. When a Daguerreotype picture is
submitted to the effects of a boiling concentrated
solution of caustic potash, before
being attacked by the acid, the state of its
surface is so modified that the acid spares
or leaves, in the part which it attacks, a
great number of prints, which form the
grain of the engraving.</p>

<p>4th. When the effects of the acid are
not sufficient, or, in other words, it is not
bitten deep enough, the effect is increased
by the following process:&mdash;Ink the plate as
copper-plate printers do, but with a siccative
ink; when the ink is sufficiently dry,
polish the white parts of the plate, and
gild it by the electrotype process; then
wash it with warm caustic potash, and bite
it in with an acid, which will not attack
the gold, but only the metal in those parts
which having been protected by the ink,
have not received the coating of gold. By
these means the engraving is completed,
as by the acid alone it is not generally bitten
in deep enough.</p>

<p>5th. To protect the plate from the effects
of wear, produced by the operation of printing,
the following process is employed: The
surface of the plate is covered with a thin
coating of copper, by the electrotype process,
before submitting it to the operation
of printing; and when that pellicle or coating
of copper begins to show signs of wear,
it must be removed altogether, by plunging
the plate in ammonia, or in a weak acid,
which, by electro-chemical action, will dissolve
the copper, without effecting the
metal under it; the plate is then coppered
again, by the same means, and is then
ready for producing a further number of
impressions. This re-coating operation
may be repeated as many times as may be
required. The following is the description
of the whole process, which is divided into
two parts, consisting of a preparatory and
printing process.</p>

<p><i>Preparatory Engraving.</i>&mdash;For this operation which is the most
delicate, it is necessary to have&mdash;1. A saturated solution of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
caustic potash. 2. Pure nitric acid at 36
of the barometer of Beaum (spec. grav.
1333). 3. A solution of nitrate of potassa,
composed of 100 parts of water, and 5 parts
of nitrate, by weight. 4. A solution of
common salt, composed of water 100 parts,
and salt 10 parts by weight. 5. A weak
solution of ammoniacal chloride of silver,
with an access of ammonia. The ammoniacal
chloride of silver must be diluted
with 15 or 20 parts of pure water. In the
description of the process, this solution will
be called ammoniacal chloride of silver.
6. A weak solution of ammonia, containing
4 or 5 thousandths of liquid ammonia.
This solution will be called ammoniacal
water. 7. A weak solution of caustic potash,
containing 4 or 5 thousandths of the
saturated solution, which will be called
alkaline water. 8. A solution composed
of water 4 parts, saturated solution of potash
2 parts, alcohol 1 part, all in volume.
This solution will be called alcoholized
potash. 9. Acidulated water, composed of
water 100 parts, and nitric acid 2 parts, in
volume. Besides, it is necessary to have
three capsul or dishes, made of porcelain,
large enough to contain the plate, and covered
with an air-tight piece of ground plate
glass, and two or three more capsul,
which do not require to be covered; two
or three glass funnels, to wash the plate;
and two or three glass holders, in the shape
of a spoon or shovel, by which the plate is
supported when put in and taken out of the
solution, without touching it with the fingers.</p>

<p>The Daguerreotype plate is submitted to
the engraving process, after having been
washed in the hyposulphate of soda, and
afterwards in distilled water.</p>

<p><i>First process for biting in or engraving
the plate.</i>&mdash;The following solutions must
be put in the capsul, in sufficient quantity,
so as to entirely cover the plate:&mdash;1. Acidulated water.
2. Alkaline water. 3. Alcoholized potash, in covered capsul. 4.
Caustic potash, in covered capsul. 5. Distilled water.</p>

<p>The plate being then put upon the glass
holder or spoon, is plunged in the acidulated
water, and agitated during a few seconds,
then put into a glass funnel, and washed
with distilled water. It is taken again
with the glass spoon, and plunged in the
capsul containing alcoholized potash.
This capsul is covered with its glass cover,
and then heated, by means of a spirit
lamp, to about 140 Fahrenheit. The
plate must remain in the capsul half an
hour, during which the solution is heated
now and then, and agitated. During that
time the following acid solution, which
will be called <i>nomal acid</i>, must be prepared: it is composed as
follows:&mdash;Water 600
parts, nitric acid 45 parts, solution of nitrate
of potassa 12 parts, solution of common
salt 45 parts. These proportions are in
volume. The nomal acid must be poured
in a capsul, covered with its glass cover,
and a sufficient quantity must be kept in the
bottle.</p>

<p>When the plate has been immersed in
the alcoholized potash during half an hour,
it is taken out of the solution by means of the
glass holder, and immediately plunged in the
alkaline water, and agitated pretty strongly;
from thence it is put in distilled water
(A). This being done, the plate is plunged
in the acidulated water, and moved about
therein for a few seconds: it is then put into
the nomal acid. When the plate has
been immersed a few seconds in the acid,
it is taken out by means of the glass holder,
taking care to keep it as much as possible
covered with the solution, and it is immediately
placed horizontally upon a stand,
and as much acid as the plate can hold is
poured upon it from the bottle; it is then
heated with a spirit lamp, but without attaining
the boiling point. During this operation
it is better to stir or move about the
acid on the plate by pumping it, and ejecting it again,
by means of a pipette or glass
syringe; after two or three minutes the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
acid is thrown away, the plate is put in the
glass funnel, and then well washed with
water, and afterwards with distilled water
(B).</p>

<p>Thus, without letting the plate dry, it is
put upon the fingers of the left hand, and
with the right hand some ammoniacal
chloride of silver, which is moved about the
surface by balancing the hand is poured
upon it; the solution is renewed until the
chloride, formed by the action of acid, is
dissolved; the plate is then washed by
pouring upon it a large quantity of ammoniacal
water, and afterwards some distilled
water. (C.)</p>

<p>Without allowing the plate to dry, it is
then put in the caustic potash, and the capsula
being then placed upon the stand,
the potash is heated up to the boiling
point; it is then left to cool (D); and beginning
again the operations described from
A, to D, a second biting is obtained; and
by repeating again the operations described
in A, and B, a third biting is produced.
The plate is then dried; in this state the
black parts of the plate are filled with
chloride of silver.</p>

<p>The plate is then polished until the white
parts are perfectly pure and bright. This polishing
is soon done with cotton and ('ponce')
(pumice stone); afterwards, the chloride
of silver, filling the black parts, is cleansed
by the means described in B, and C. The
plate is dried, but before drying, it is well
to rub the plate slightly with the finger, in
order to take off from the black parts any remains
of an insoluble body, which generally
remains on it. The preparatory engraving
is then finished, and the plate has the appearance
of a very delicate acquatint engraved
plate, not very deeply bitten in.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if the operation has been
well managed, and has been successful, it
is deep enough to allow the printing of a
considerable number of copies.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Sometimes, instead of treating
the plate with the boiling potash in the capsula,
a similar result may be obtained by
placing the plate upon the stand, covering
it with the solution, and heating it by means
of a spirit lamp, until, by evaporation the
potash becomes in a state of ignited fusion.
By this means the grain is finer, but the
white parts are more liable to be attacked.</p>

<p>Last operation of biting in: This operation
requires some of the re-agents, before-named,
and also,</p>

<p>1. A siccative ink, made of linseed oil,
rendered very siccative by boiling it sufficiently
with litharge; it may be thickened
with calcined lampblack.</p>

<p>2. An electrotype apparatus, and some
solutions of it to gild, and copper the plate.</p>

<p>Means of operating: The plate must be
inked as copper-plate printers do, taking care
to clean off the white parts more perfectly
than usual; the plate is then to be placed
in a room sufficiently warm, until the ink is
well dried, which requires more or less
time, according to the nature of the oil employed.
The drying of the oil may be
hastened by heating the plate upon the
stand with the lamp, but the slow process
is more perfect and certain.</p>

<p>When the ink is well dried, the white
parts are cleaned again, by polishing the
plate with cotton and ponce, or any other
polishing powder; a ball of cotton, or any
other matter covered over with a thin piece
of caoutchouc or skin, can be used for this
purpose. When polished the plate is ready
to receive the electro-chemical coating of
gold, which will protect the white parts.</p>

<p><i>Gilding.</i>&mdash;The gilding is obtained by
any of the various processes of electrotyping
that are known. The only indispensable
condition is, that the surface obtained
by the precipitation must not be liable to be
attacked by the weak acid; a solution answering
this purpose is made of 10 parts,
(by weight), of ferocganide of potassium;
1 part of chloride of gold, and 1,000 parts
of water, used with a galvanic battery.
During the gilding the plate must be turned
in several positions, in order to regulate the
metallic deposit. In some cases the gilding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
may be made more perfect, if the plate is
covered with a thin coating of mercury before
putting in the gilding solution.</p>

<p>When the plate is gilded, it must be heated
with the boiling caustic potash, by the
process already indicated for the preparatory
engraving, in order to cleanse it from
all the dried oil or ink, which fills the hollow.
The plate is then washed and dried,
and when the oil employed has been thickened
with the lampblack, the surface of the
plate is rubbed with crumbs of bread, in order
to cleanse and take off the black remaining;
then, the white parts being covered and
protected by varnish not liable to be attacked,
and the black parts being uncovered and
clean, the plate can be bitten in by aqua-fortis,
according to the ordinary process
used by engravers.</p>

<p>This operation must be used upon the
stand, and not by immersing the plate in
the solution.</p>

<p>Before this biting in, if the preparatory
engraving has not succeeded well, and the
plate still wants a sufficient grain, it can be
given by the various processes of aquatint
engraving.</p>

<p>Before submitting the plate to the operation
of printing, in order to insure an unlimited
number of copies, it is necessary, as
before stated, to protect it by a slight coating
of copper, which is obtained by the
electrotype process; otherwise the printing
would soon wear the plate. This coating
must be kept very thin, but the fineness of
the engraving, and the polish of the white
parts, should be destroyed. In this state
the plate can be delivered to the printer.</p>

<p>After a certain number of impressions
have been obtained, it will be perceived
that the coating of copper is worn in some
places; then this coating must be removed,
and a fresh one applied in its place. For
this purpose, the plate must be purified and
cleansed by warm potash, and plunged in
a weak acid, composed as follows:&mdash;Water, 600 parts; nitric acid, 50 parts;
nitrous acid of engravers, 5 parts; all in volume. This
acid will dissolve the coating
of copper, and the plate being coppered
again, by the same means as before, may
be again submitted to the operation of printing; and as nothing
can prevent the success
of a repetition of the same operation, any
number of impressions may be obtained.
The coating of copper can also be removed
by caustic ammonia. The Daguerreotype
plate engraved by this process, may also be
reproduced and multiplied by the electrotype
process, the same as any other engraved
plate.</p>

<p>The essential points of this process,
which constitute the present invention, consist,&mdash;</p>

<p>First,&mdash;in the discovery and employment
of certain properties of a mixture composed
of nitric acid, nitrous acid, and hydrochloric
acid, in detrimental or fixed proportions.
The two last mentioned acids may
be employed either in a free state, or combined
with alkaline or other bases. This
mixed acid has the property of biting the
pure silver, which forms the black parts of
the Daguerreotype picture, without attacking
the white parts formed by the amalgam
of mercury.</p>

<p>The result of the action of the biting is,
to form on the black part of the picture
an insoluble chloride of silver; and this
chloride of silver, which, when formed,
stops the action of the acid, is dissolved by
the ammonia, which allows the biting to
continue.</p>

<p>Secondly,&mdash;In the discovery of certain
properties of a warm solution of caustic
potash, and in the employment of the said
solution, by which the mercury forming the
picture is better and deeper amalgamated
with the silver under it, so that many imperceptible
points of the amalgam are affected
in such a manner that the action has
no action upon them.</p>

<p>Thirdly,&mdash;In the discovery and employment
of a process which produces a grain
favourable to the engraving, by which the
biting on the plate is rendered deeper. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
is effected by filling the parts engraved with
a siccative ink, or any other substance, and
then gilding the plate by the electrotype
process: the gold is not deposited on the
parts protected by the ink. When the plate
is gilded, the ink is cleansed by the caustic
potash, and the plate may be submitted to
the effect of an acid, which does not attack
the coating of gold, but bites only on the
silver in the parts already engraved by the
first operation.</p>

<p>Fourthly,&mdash;In the employment of a process
by which the plate is protected from
the wear of the printing operation. This
is effected by covering the plate before
printing, with a slight coating of copper;
by the electrotype process, and when the
coating begins to wear, by printing, it is
removed by a weak acid or by ammonia,
which dissolves the copper without effecting
the silver under it. The plate is coppered
again, and after another printing, the
same operation is repeated, so that a considerable
number of copies may be printed
without injury to the engraving.</p>

<h2><a name="INTERESTING_EXPERIMENT_WITH_STRYCHNIA" id="INTERESTING_EXPERIMENT_WITH_STRYCHNIA">INTERESTING EXPERIMENT WITH STRYCHNIA.</a></h2>


<p>An interesting experiment, illustrative of
the poisonous effects of strychnia, was recently
made by Professor Agassiz, at Cambridge.
The subject was a large black
bear, about eighteen months old. The
animal was taken when young, and had
been kept in captivity for a considerable
period. Professor Agassiz being desirous
of killing it for the purpose of dissection,
about three grains of strychnia were administered.
The poison, though extremely
bitter was readily swallowed. At the expiration
of ten minutes, no effect having
been produced, a second dose of about the
same quantity was also inclosed in a biscuit
and offered. The cunning animal
broke open and swallowed the biscuit, but
rejected the poison. The first portion,
however, had proved efficacious, and in
exactly fifteen minutes from the time
when first administered, the animal was
seized with terrible convulsions, and soon
died.</p>

<p>The whole time which elapsed between
the taking of the poison and the death of
the animal, did not exceed twenty-five
minutes. In order to alleviate its sufferings
and hasten death, a quantity of hydrocyanic
acid was poured upon the nose and
mouth of the bear. It did not, however,
produce any sensible effect, and was not
apparently taken into the system, as the
animal at the time was nearly dead. But
the subsequent effects of the poison were
most remarkable. Although the bear, at
the time of death, was in perfect health
and strength, twenty-four hours had not
elapsed before the body was in an advanced
stage of decomposition. Indeed
the appearances indicated that the animal
had been dead for nearly two months.
The interior of the body, when opened
about twenty hours after death, still retained
its warmth in a considerable degree,
while an offensive gas issued from every
pore. The blood had not coagulated, the
spinal marrow and nerves were in a semi-fluid
state, and the flesh had assumed a
leaden-gray color. The hair of the hide
readily came out on being slightly pulled.
No smell of the hydrocyanic acid could be
perceived.</p>

<p>The origin of this singular and speedy
decomposition is not fully known, though
it is supposed to be due to the agency of
the hydrocyanic acid. A chemical examination
of the muscle, brain, nerves, liver
and kidneys is now going on at the Cambridge
laboratory, under the direction of
Professor Horsford. One singular fact connected
with the spontaneous decomposition
of these parts is, that they all yielded or
disengaged hydrosulphuric acid gas, with
the exception of the liver, which did not.&mdash;<i>Annual of Scientific Discovery.</i></p>

<p>The metal which the Daguerreotypists
have most to deal with is silver. To obtain
plates of this perfectly clean and keep
them so is one of the most difficult parts of
his art; in order to accomplish it he is
obliged to have resource to circuitous mechanical
processes, or to some chemical
means whereby the old surface may be removed,
or a new surface deposited. He
uses tripoli and rotten stone, rouge and
buffing, fatty matters, alcohol, ammonia,
and nitric acid, for the first purpose; and
electro-plating for the second. The operator
must not mistake the object he has in
view. By all his mechanical operations,
where friction is concerned, he obtains a
<i>polished</i> surface; but it is not to <i>polish</i> the
plate that he uses the buff, and the other
materials; the object is to clean the plate,
and the <i>polish</i> of the surface follows as a
natural result. That a polished surface is
not necessary for the formation of an image
is evident from photography on paper, and
Hyalotype. In these cases the surfaces do
not reflect light; they are not polished;
they are merely clean. The fact of a plate
freshly taken out of a cell where silver has
been deposited on it receiving beautiful
images, is another proof that polish is unnecessary
for success. What is wanted is
a surface of pure silver, one not coated
with the slightest trace of oxide, carbonate,
or sulphuret of silver, or with
any impurity derived by contact with foreign
matter. The Daguerreotypist has,
then, two objects in view.&mdash;1st, to get a
clean surface on his plate; and 2nd, this
once obtained, to keep it so without further
alteration. Although silver is classed with
gold and platinum, as one of those metals
which do not tarnish or oxidize readily on
exposure to the air, yet it is now well
known in practice what a difference exists
in the character of the picture brought out
on a plate recently polished and one set
aside even for a few hours. It is true that
the atmosphere alone will not affect or oxidize
a plate of polished silver, but that is
only true of a very dry atmosphere; for an
atmosphere which contains even a small
amount of moisture in it, will in a short
time dull the surface of the plate. In this
instance the moisture is deposited first, and
brings the air into closer contact with the
surface of the metal, promoting the union
of the latter with the oxygen of the air.
This is exemplified every day in the case of
iron, which does not rust in dry weather,
but when the air begins to deposit its moisture
it rapidly oxydizes. So is it with lead
and zinc, but in a less degree. Pure water
has no effect in tarnishing the surface of a
silver plate, but if it contains even a very
small quantity of animal or vegetable matter
it darkens the surface in consequence of
the presence of sulphur. The ordinary
tarnish of silver is due to the fastening upon
the surface of sulfurous vapors, which
are constantly floating in the air. We are
scarcely yet in possession of sufficient facts
to justify the statement that sun-light materially
aids in this alteration. We do
know that oxidizement in any substance
goes on much more rapidly in sunshine
than under any other circumstances. In the
vegetable kingdom it is of hourly occurrence;
but the different effects of shade
and shine upon the oxidizement of plates of
metal has not been minutely studied. However
this may be, after a time the silver
surface does get coated with a film, of partly sulphuret,
partly oxide, and a complete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
layer of air, which so closely attaches itself
to the plate that water when poured on it
rolls off and does not wet the surface. It
is this film, of air which mechanical friction
and bulling are so serviceable in removing.
The tarnish of a sulphuret is not so
readily removed by friction as by ammonia,
for the sulphuret of silver is, to some extent,
soluble in ammonia; but as the sulphuret
when present gives a yellowish
brown tint to the surface, it is only then
that it is needful, and even a weak solution
of commom salt or hydrodate of potash
cleans the surface much quicker.</p>

<p>As nitric acid is the best solvent of silver,
so is it the best agent to remove films of
oxide and carbonate from the surface; it
does so readily, effectually, and leaves a
clean new surface of silver, similar to a
plate newly prepared, or one which has received
a new coating in the electrotype
cell. The acid, however, must be very
much diluted, otherwise its local action is
so immediate as to eat down the surface of
the plate faster than it spreads, producing
inequalities,&mdash;even when left long on, although
diluted, it produces roughness;
hence its use has not been happy in many
hands. To such, the longer, but less failing
processes of mechanical action are to
be recommended in preference.</p>

<p class="p0"><a id="L_L_Hill"></a><span class="smcap">Friend Humphrey</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>I have thought for some time past that I
would furnish a few thoughts for the
<i>Daguerreian Journal</i>, under the head of
<i>General Rumors</i>. A fear of injuring the
Daguerreian business, by giving an additional
publicity to my discovery, for the
present has kept me from this, as well as
from furnishing several other articles.</p>

<p>A <i>very few</i> persons (for the honor of
humanity, I am glad the number is small)
have made statements which reflect seriously
upon the integrity and motives of
myself and friends. By means of certain
legal processes, of which I am not wholly
ignorant, I could do <i>these gentry</i> more
simple justice than by dignifying them by
a notice in our Journal, yet I bear them
no ill will, and <i>for the present</i> shall act
on the principle that it is better to suffer
wrong than to engage in a quarrel,
especially with men who have so little
regard for the feelings and reputation of
their fellows, as to condemn, denounce,
and accuse, without discrimination, and
without the slightest knowledge of facts.</p>

<p>The "head and front of my offending" is
this&mdash;that I <i>have</i>, by dint of unwearied
pains and perseverance, succeeded in imprinting
the colors of nature, in all their inimitable
glory, upon the metallic surface.
The process, when brought out, it is
believed, by the best of judges, will be an
astonishment to, the world, and a delight to
our nation; and I have felt, from the first,
that I am but an instrument in the hands
of the Almighty, and am therefore bound
in duty, as well as by inclination, to dispose
of the secret in a way to accomplish
the greatest amount of good. In this
spirit I have frequently published my unalterable
resolve that my process <i>shall
never be monopolized, or used for the purposes
of extortion</i>. If I had no other
reason for this course, the fact that there
are great numbers of worthy persons engaged
in our art, who, like myself, are
poor, this would be sufficient. Various
plans have been suggested to me, for the
best possible method of disposing of my
discovery. Numerous gentlemen of high
standing, have honored me with personal
intercourse and friendly advice. I have
even suffered the claims of courtesy to interfere
with my experiments, and, I believe
I have the good will and confidence of
those who have honored me with their
visits; but I have never swerved from my
original determination, and have given no
person the slightest reason to think otherwise.</p>

<p>In view of these <i>facts</i>, it is not strange
that I should feel annoyed at the various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
rumors to which I refer, and some of the
intimations which have been thrown out,
I <i>feel</i> are but poor pay for my having
nearly, if not quite, ruined my health, by
laboring from morn till midnight for the
good of others. More especially have I
been <i>grieved</i> that <i>some of my best friends,
and the best friends of the fraternity</i>,
should be accused of having outwitted me,
and drawn me into obligations to them
which would compel me to pursue a grasping
course. Now, it is true that certain
gentlemen have, from the most honorable
motives, made me very liberal offers of aid,
and it is also true that my mind is about
settled in regard to the parties with whom
I shall act; but it is not true that I am
under obligations to give notoriety to my
<i>business affairs</i>, and it is certain that I
shall not do so until I see fit. Neither is
there the least foundation for the assertion
that I am committed to any person. There
confidence in me is not based on paper, but
on a much surer foundation.</p>

<p>The process which I have been so fortunate
as to discover, is <i>my property</i>. No
man on earth has any claim, upon it, and I
have a perfect right to dispose of it as I
please, in case I do not interfere with the
rights of others. This, I think, is the
philosophy of <i>Professor Morse</i>, so admirably
and clearly expressed in the last
number of the Journal. This distinguished
man recently favored me with a visit, and,
in the course of the interview, shed much
light on this subject for which I feel truly
thankful.</p>

<p>My intention has been, and is, to <i>do
right</i>, and I believe the majority approve
of the course I have pursued thus far. The
many marks of approbation I have received
from eminent men, both in this profession
and others, is truly encouraging to me in
my poor health and arduous labors, and
will never be forgotten. Those who seem
to possess a different spirit, and who have
apparently endeavored to hedge up my
way by means of "rumors," "new discoveries,"
"threats," &amp;c., have my forgiveness, and I trust that, in future, if they
are not disposed to aid, they will do nothing
to hinder me.</p>

<p>The brotherhood have nobly aided
me, by purchasing my book. My sales
are exceeding my most sanguine expectations,
and are placing me on a footing
to make me <i>feel that I am free</i>. All may
be assured that I shall not use my freedom
"as a cloak," but to serve their interests,
of which both myself and friends hope to
give them <i>full proof</i> hereafter.</p>

<p>Now that I have been compelled to close
my doors against visitors, I would state
that I am doing my utmost to bring out my
process in a short time, and I will hereafter
give, in the <i>Daguerreian Journal</i>,
such notices of my success as will meet the
wishes of the public, as well as the interest
of our fraternity,</p>

<p><a id="S_A_Wolcott"></a>We take pleasure in saying to our friends
that, through the kindness of John Johnson,
Esq., of this city, we have received many
of the valuable letters and papers written
by Mr. <span class="smcap">S. A. Wolcott</span>, a former partner
of the first named gentleman. Mr. W. is
well and favorably known as one of our
early and most successful investigators in
the Photogenic Art. Many of the most
valuable improvements had their origin
in his hands. We were surprised to find
so great an amount of information as is
here presented.</p>

<p>Our Daguerreotypists of the present day
may consider themselves fortunate, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
looking back upon the difficulties experienced
by those early engaged in putting
a shadow on the silver plate. We find
here many a mystery unravelled, and set
forth in a light heretofore unexplained.
As these letters, written by Mr. W. to his
partner, Mr. J., (at the time they were
written) were many of them confidential,
and some few contain business matter of a
foreign character, it will require some little
time to prepare them for the press in the
order in which they were written. We
shall make no alteration in the manuscript,
and exclude such matter only as relates to
business of a foreign character. They
present a team of investigation and research
worthy the first in the scientific circle.</p>

<p>We would here take occasion to speak
of a curious specimen of our art, which we
saw while recently spending an evening
with Mr. Johnson. This specimen is a
profile view of a gentleman, and if not the
<i>first</i> likeness from life, it is said to claim
age with the oldest Daguerreotype ever
produced, and is no less interesting for
its antiquity than for its size, it being on a
plate <i>less than one quarter of an inch square</i>.
To produce an impression on such a plate
it would require the superior skill of the
most successful operator of the present day.
The outline is distinctly marked, the features
remarkably well delineated, being
in fact, one of the most interesting curiosities
we have ever witnessed. The plate is
cemented by means of Canada Balsam to a
piece of plate glass about three-fourths of
an inch square, and thus it has been preserved
in its present state.</p>

<p>We saw many other specimens of Daguerreian
antiquity, but as we intend to
speak more fully of our evening visit at
Mr. Johnson's, we will defer further notice
for the present.</p>

<p>We would here say to such as may have
Mr. Walcott's letters relative to the art,
that we would consider ourselves especially
favored if we could be allowed the
perusal of them.</p>

<p>At one o'clock the steamer Goliath was
ready to start across the Channel, with all
the necessary apparatus on board, and a
crew of about thirty men. Between the
paddle-wheels, in the centre of the vessel,
was a gigantic drum, or wheel, nearly fifteen
feet long and seven feet in diameter,
weighing seven tons, and fixed on a strong
framework. Upon it was coiled up, in
careful, close convulsions, about thirty miles
of telegraphic wire, one-tenth of an inch in
diameter, incased in a covering of gutta-percha,
the thickness of the little finger.
The point proposed to be reached, Cape
Grinez, the nearest landmark to the English
coast, and between Calais and Boulogne, is
a distance of twenty-one miles, so that a
surplus supply of nine miles of wire was
held in reserve for the purpose of slackening.
The connecting wires were placed in
readiness at the Government pier in the
harbor, and likewise at the Cape, where
they run up the face of the acclivity, which
is 194 feet above the sea-mark.</p>

<p>Some interesting experiments were first
made upon a small scale to show the practicability
of the plan. A mile of wire was
paid out off the deck, from the pier to
Shakspeare's Cliff, and the sinking process
was proved to be a practicable performance.
A communication was also sent through
twenty four miles of wire. On Wednesday
morning the experiment of sinking
submarinely was practically commenced.
The Goliath put out to the pier, with her
telegraphic tackle and apparatus on board,
under a calm sea and sky and a favoring
wind. The connection between the thirty
miles of telegraphic wire was then made
good to 300 yards of the same wire inclosed
in a leaden tube on shore, to prevent it
being bruised by the shingle on the beach,
and to enable the experimenters, as they
proceeded out to sea, to send communications
on shore. The vessel steamed out at
the rate of three or four miles an hour into
the open sea, in a direct track for Cape
Grinez. The wire weighed five tons and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the cylinder two. The operation of paying
out the thirty miles of wire commenced on
a signal to the sailors to "Go-ahead with
the wheel, and pay out the wire," which
was continuously streamed out over a roller
at the stern of the vessel, the men at
every 16th of a mile being busily engaged
in riveting on to the wire, square leaden
clamps, or weights of iron, from 14 lbs. to
24 lbs. in weight, which had the effect of
sinking the wire to the bottom, which, on
the English coast commences at a depth of
30 feet, and goes on varying from that to
100 and 180 feet, which latter, or 30 fathoms,
is the greatest depth.</p>

<p>The whole of the casting out and sinking
was accomplished with great precision
and success, owing to the favorable state of
the day. The only conjectured difficulty on
the route was at a point in midchannel,
called the Ridge, between which and another
inequality called the Varne, both well
known and dreaded by navigators, there is
a deep submarine valley, surrounded by
shifting sands, the one being seventeen
miles in length, and the other twelve, and
in their vortex, not unlike the voracious
one of Godwin Sands, ships encounter danger
and lose their anchors, and trolling nets
of fishermen are frequently lost. Over this,
however, the wire was successfully submerged,
below the reach, it is believed, of
either ship's anchors, sea-animals, or fishing
nets. The remainder of the route,
though rougher on approaching the coast
of France, was accomplished cleverly, but
slowly. A communication, dated Cape
Grinez, Coast of France, half past eight,
P. M., and received at Dover by submarine
telegraph, was as follows:&mdash;"The Goliath
has just arrived in safety, and the complete
connection of the under-water wire with
that left at Dover this morning is being run
up the face of the cliff; complimentary
interchanges are passing between France
and England, under the strait and through
it, for the first time."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this apparently successful
result of the work, the line was cut asunder
soon after the connection was completed
on the rocks near Cape Grinez, the
physical configuration of the French coast
being very unfavorable. The precise point
where the breakage took place was about
two hundred yards out to sea, just where the
twenty miles of electric line that had been
laid down from Dover joins on to a leaden
tube designed to protect it from the surge
beating against the beach, and which also
serves a similar purpose up the front of the
cliff to the station upon the top. The
leaden conductor, it would appear, was of
too soft a texture to resist the oscillation of
the sea, and thereby became detached from
the coil of gutta-percha wire that was
thought to have been safely encased in it.
The occurrence was, of course, quickly detected
by the sudden cessation of the series
of communications, though it was at first a
perplexing point to discover at what precise
spot the wire was broken or at fault. This,
however, was done by hauling up the line
at intervals, a process which disclosed the
gratifying fact, that, since its first sinking,
it had remained in situ at the bottom of
the sea, inconsequence of the leaden weights
or clamps that were strung to it at every
sixteenth of a mile. The experiment, as
far as it has gone, proves the possibility of
the gutta percha wire resisting the action
of the salt water, of the fact of its being a
perfect waterproof insulator, and that the
weights on the wire are sufficient to prevent
it being drifted away by the currents,
and for sinking it in the sands.</p>

<p>The work at present has been suspended,
but will be resumed again during the spring
of 1851; a somewhat different plan, however,
has been proposed to be followed from
that at first adopted. Instead of one slender
wire, it is intended to lay down cables
inclosing four lines. These cables will be
composed of gutta-percha, four or five
inches in thickness, the whole encased in
wire rope, chemically prepared, to protect
it from rot, and kyanized. There will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
two of these cables, each twenty miles long,
and three miles apart, the whole weight
representing 400 tons; and it is expected,
when chained down in the bottom of the
sea, they will be of sufficient consistency
and strength to resist the anchor of a 120-gun
ship. The expense of the cables is
estimated at 40,000. It is thought that
the whole work may be accomplished by
May, 1851.&mdash;<i>Annual of Scientific Discovery.</i></p>

<h2><a name="ACTION_OF_SOLUTIONS_OF_CHLORIDES_AND_AIR_ON_MERCURY" id="ACTION_OF_SOLUTIONS_OF_CHLORIDES_AND_AIR_ON_MERCURY"><b>ACTION OF SOLUTIONS OF CHLORIDES AND AIR ON MERCURY.</b></a></h2>


<p>We have given in previous Numbers the
results of M. Mialhe's experiments on the
action of chlorides on some mercurial compounds,
and he states that he had nearly
concluded his experiments when it occurred
to him to try whether mercury itself
would not be acted upon by this class of
substances.</p>

<p>Experiment, he states, confirmed his suspicions,
for he found that the solutions of
the alkaline chlorides put into contact with
mercury and atmospheric air always produced
bichloride of mercury, the quantity
of which was greater in proportion to the
concentration of the solution of the chloride,
and the more perfect state of division
of the metal, but no effect is produced unless
oxygen, that of the air being sufficient,
is present.</p>

<p><i>1st Experiment.</i>&mdash;Mercury treated with
the solution of alkaline chlorides (described
in our last Number as the assay liquor ),
gave by stove heat 04 part of sublimate.</p>

<p><i>2nd Experiment.</i>&mdash;The above repeated
with the mercury finely divided by mucilage,
yielded 07 part of sublimate.</p>

<p>The researches already detailed sufficiently
prove, in the opinion of M. Mialhe,
that the decomposing power of the alkaline
chlorides is great, but they do not teach us
anything as to their relative energy. The
following experiments will supply this deficiency.</p>

<p><i>Hydrochlorate of Ammonia.</i>&mdash;One hundred
and twenty parts of hydrochlorate of
ammonia and 30 parts of calomel were
placed in an open bottle containg 1000 parts
of distilled water, the temperature of which
was gradually raised to 122 Fahr., and
kept for half an hour; the sublimate produced amounted to 09 of a part.</p>

<p>The experiment repeated with the following
salts gave the annexed quantities of
sublimate:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="data">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Chloride of Sodium,</td>
  <td>04</td>
  <td class="tdc">of a part.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Chloride of Barium,</td>
  <td>04</td>
  <td class="tdc">"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Chloride of Potassium,</td>
  <td>03</td>
  <td class="tdc">"</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>It results from these experiments that the
hydrochlorate of ammonia is the most powerful
of these four salts.</p>

<p>In concluding his experiments, M. Mialhe
remarks that the reactions which he has
pointed out take place at common temperatures,
but better at the temperature of the
human body. All of them are produced in
a short time, and some occur instantaneously,
the greater part requiring only a few
hours' contact for action. As then the
different fluids contained in the human
body contain oxygen, chloride of sodium,
and hydrochlorate of ammonia, accompanied
or not with hydrochloric and other acids
which may facilitate their action, it follows
that all the chemical phenomena produced
under the circumstances described, occur in
the human body when any mercurial preparation
whatever is introduced into it;
these always produce a certain quantity of
corrosive sublimate in which their medicinal
properties reside; and this fact explains, in
the opinion of M. Mialhe, the hitherto unexplained
physiological action and therapeutic
properties of metallic mercury when
introduced into the animal economy.&mdash;<i>Ann. de Chim. et de Phys.</i>, Juin 1842.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_HEAT_OF_COMBINATIONS" id="THE_HEAT_OF_COMBINATIONS"><b>THE HEAT OF COMBINATIONS.</b></a></h2>


<p>Every molecular change in the condition
of matter is almost invariably connected
with the evolution or absorption of heat,
and the quantity of heat thus set free or
absorbed bears always a definite relation to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the amount of the mechanical or chemical
action. To ascertain this relation has been
the object of my investigations, and the following
are a few of my principal results.
1. The solution of a salt in water is always
accompanied by an absorption of heat. 2.
If equal weights of the same salt be dissolved
in succession in the same liquid, the
heat absorbed will be less on each new addition
of salt. 3. The heat absorbed by the
solution of a salt in water holding other
salts dissolved is generally less than that
absorbed by its solution in water. 4. The
heat absorbed by the solution of a salt in
the dilute mineral acids is generally greater
than that absorbed by its solution in water.
In reference to the combination of acids
and bases, the heat developed during the
union is determined by the base, and not by
the acid. An equivalent of the same base
combined with different acids produces
nearly the same quantity of heat. When
a neutral salt is converted into an acid salt
by combining with one or more equivalents
of acids, no disengagement of heat occurs.
When a double salt is formed by the union
of two neutral salts, the same is the case,
but when a neutral salt is converted into a
basic salt, there is a disengagement of heat.
When solutions of two neutral salts are
mixed, and a precipitate formed from their
mutual decomposition, there is always a
disengagement of heat, which, though
small, is perfectly definite in amount. The
diamond disengages 7,824 units of heat during
its combustion in oxygen gas, in the
form of graphite, 7,778 units, and in that of
wood charcoal, 8,080.&mdash;Dr. Andrews before
the British Association at Birmingham.</p>

<h2><a name="DAGUERREOTYPE" id="DAGUERREOTYPE"><b>DAGUERREOTYPE.</b></a></h2>

<hr class="r10" />

<p class="caption3nb">BY JOHN JOHNSON.</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>As a general thing, however perfect any
invention may be deemed by the inventor
or discoverer, it falls to the lot of most, to
be the subject of improvement and advancement, and especially is this the case with
those new projects in science which open
an untrodden field to the view of the artizan.
Such has been in an eminent degree,
the case with the discovery first announced
to the world by Mons. Jean Jacques Claude
Daguerre, of Paris, in the year 1839, and
which excited unbounded astonishment,
curiosity and surprise. It may be questioned
had any other than Daguerre himself
discovered a like beautiful combination,
whether the world would have been favored
with details exhibiting so much care,
patience and perseverance as the Daguerreotype
on its introduction. Shortly after
these details reached the United States, by
Professor S. F. B. Morse, of New York,
who was, at the time of the discovery, residing
in Paris. By this announcement,
the whole scientific corps was set in operation,
many repeating the experiments, following
carefully the directions pointed out
by Daguerre, as being necessary to success.
Among the number in the United States,
was Alexander S. Wolcott (since deceased)
and myself, both of this city. On the
morning of the 6th day of October, 1839, I
took to A. Wolcott's residence, a full description
of Daguerre's discovery, he being
at the time engaged in the department of
Mechanical Dentistry, on some work requiring
his immediate attention, the work
being promised at 2 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, that day; having,
therefore, no opportunity to read the
description for himself, (a thing he was accustomed
to do at all times, when investigating
any subject,) I read to him the
paper, and proposed to him that if he
would plan a camera, (a matter he was
fully acquainted with, both theoretically
and practically) I would obtain the materials
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
as specified by Daguerre. This being
agreed to, I departed for the purpose, and
on my return to his shop, he handed
me the sketch of a camera box, without at
all explaining in what manner the lens
was to be mounted. This I also undertook
to procure. After 2 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, he had more
leisure, when he proceeded to complete the
camera, introducing for that purpose a reflector
in the back of the box, and also to
affix a plate holder on the inside, with a
slide to obtain the focus of the plate, prepared
after the manner of Daguerre.
While Mr. Wolcott was engaged with the
camera, I busied myself in polishing the
silver plate, or rather silver plated copper,
but ere reaching the end preparatory to
iodizing, I found I had nearly or quite removed
the silver surface from off the plate,
and that being the best piece of silver
plated copper to be found, the first remedy
at hand that suggested itself, was a burnisher,
and a few strips were quickly burnished
and polished. Meantime, the camera
being finished, Mr. Wolcott, after reading
for himself Daguerre's method of iodizing,
prepared two plates, and placing them in
the camera, guessed at the required time
they should remain exposed to the action
of the light; after mercurializing each in
turn, and removing the iodized surface
with a solution of common salt, two successful
impressions were obtained, each
unlike the other! Considerable surprise
was excited by this result, for each plate
was managed precisely like the other. On
referring to Daguerre, no explanation was
found for this strange result; time, however,
revealed to us that one picture was
positive, and the other negative. On this
subject I shall have much to say during the
progress of the work. Investigating the
cause of this difference occupied the remainder
of that day, However, another
attempt was agreed upon, and the instruments,
plates, &amp;c., prepared and taken up
into an attic room, in a position most favorable
for light. Having duly arranged the
camera, I sat for five minutes, and the result
was a profile miniature, (a miniature
in reality,) on a plate not quite three-eighths
of an inch square. Thus, with
much deliberation and study, passed the
first day in Daguerreotype&mdash;little dreaming
or knowing into what a labyrinth such a
beginning was hastening us.</p>

<h2><a name="GALVANIZING_DAGUERREOTYPE_PLATES" id="GALVANIZING_DAGUERREOTYPE_PLATES"><b>GALVANIZING DAGUERREOTYPE PLATES.</b></a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The Battery.</span> The best way is to purchase a good
<span class="smcap">Daniel's Battery</span>. Price
$2 00. To be had at any of the dealers.</p>

<p>For the benefit of those who cannot procure
one, I would give the following directions
for making one: Procure a copper cup,
(sheet copper) 6 inches high, and 4 inches
in diameter; also a cup of porous earthenware,
(a small unglazed flower pot answers,) or a leather cup made water tight
by sewing, or even a cylinder of porous
wood, (say maple or ash,) 3 inches diameter,
and about 6 inches high. This is to stand
in the centre of the copper cup. Now,
procure a solid cylinder of zinc, 6 inches
high and 1 inch diameter. This is to stand
in the centre of the porous cup. Fastened
to the upper end of the zinc cylinder there
should be a copper wire, pretty thick. It
should be held by a screw, or soldered on,
and previous to the fastening, both the wire
and zinc should be made clean and bright,
that there may be a perfect connection. A
similar wire is to be fastened, in the same
way, to the upper rim of the copper cup.
Let these wires be about 6 inches long.
To the end of the one coming from the copper
fasten a plate of pure silver, about as
large as a quarter plate, unless you wish to
galvanize whole plates, in which case the
silver plate must be larger, say, the size of
a half plate. For small plates a silver dollar,
enlarged to twice its size by hammering,
will answer, but is not so good. To
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
hammer it, it must be first heated, red hot,
and allowed to cool slowly. This plate is
to be immersed in the silver solution, described
below, near the side of the solution
jar. The other wire must be bent at the
end like a hook, to receive the catch. This
catch may be a piece of copper wire about
4 inches long, hooked at one end, and having
several turns at the other end, to strengthen
it. Between these turns the Daguerreotype
plate, well polished, is inserted, as in a sort
of jaw. The wire holding the catch should
be so bent that the Daguerreotype plate
will stand from one to three inches from,
and face the annode, or silver plate.</p>

<p>Let the silver solution be well stirred,
just before immersing a plate; then, blowing
away the froth and scum, immediately
dip the plate, and hang it on the wire. Let
it remain until it takes on a deep blue color,
take it out, grasp it with the plyers, rinse it
freely with clean water, and dry it carefully
with a spirit lamp. Buff again to a polish,
galvanize to a light blue, rinse, dry, and
buff again, and it is ready for the coating
box.</p>

<p><i>Silver Solution.</i> Dissolve in 1 quart of
soft water, half a pound of <i>Cyanide of
Potash</i>. In this dissolve the <i>Chloride of
Silver</i> procurable from a silver dollar. Filter,
through paper, or clean sponge, and it
is ready for use, excepting that it will probably
have to be reduced with water. It
should be reduced till it works mellow, and
free from streaks. The occasional addition
of a lump of cyanide will prevent a flowery
deposite of oxyde of silver. Occasionally,
also, add a little chloride of silver, and more
cyanide. The cyanide should always be in
excess. The reason why this should be occasionally
added, is that the solution becomes
too strong, with the silver, from the
annode. The connections must be kept
bright, with a file or otherwise.</p>

<p>The manner of charging the above battery
is as follows: Nearly fill the porous
cup with water, and stir in about a tea-spoonful
of sulphuric acid. Two or three
drops of acid added once a week is enough.
The copper cup should be filled with a saturated
solution of sulphate of copper, (blue
vitriol,) and the solution kept saturated by
suspending in it a little sack of the blue vitriol.</p>

<p class="p0"><img src="images/hand.png" width="21" height="12" alt="Hand" /> The zinc cylinder, previous to use,
should be amalgamated, as follows: Place
it in a plate, and brighten it by rubbing it
with a swab, wet with dilute sulphuric acid.
Then with the same swab, rub on mercury,
until the whole surface is bright.</p>

<p>Chloride of Silver. Dissolve a silver
dollar in about a gill of a mixture of nitric
acid and water, equal parts, by the aid of a
gentle heat. Let it cool. Throw it into
an earthen or glass vessel, containing about
1 quart of strong salt water. Let the precipitate
settle. Pour away the liquid, add
a large quantity of water, let the chloride
of silver settle, pour away the water, and
repeat this at least fifty times. The residue
is pure chloride of silver.</p>

<p>Any glass or earthen cup, of suitable
shape and dimensions, will answer for a
solution dish.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that a strong
battery, and a strong solution require the
plate to be kept at a greater distance from
the annode. This distance will range from
one to three inches.&mdash;<i>Hill's Treatise.</i></p>

have received the different premiums for Mr. Brady, were taken, colored,

coloring tone and finish of the impressions from this establishment,

his charges being extremely moderate, he hopes to suit all classes.</p>

<p class="caption3nb">POSTAGE ON THE DAGUERREIAN JOURNAL</p>

<p>THERE has been a few instances where Postmasters have charged pamphlet
postage on this Journal. We say the Daguerreian Journal is "subject to
newspaper postage only," because that is all that can legally be charged
on it. A newspaper must be published as often as "once a month," and
contain intelligence of passing events.</p>

<p>This publication is semi-monthly, and contains, a general summary of
"passing events." The law says it may contain two sheets, if the two
together do not exceed 1,900 square inches. This Journal contains less
than 1,100 square inches. These sheets may be folded in any shape, or
printed on paper of any color. The following is an extract from the Act of
Congress for regulating postage.</p>

<p>"A newspaper is defined to be any printed publication issued in numbers,
and published at stated intervals of not more than a month, conveying
intelligence of passing events. It generally consists of a sheet, but may
be composed of two sheets of paper. In such case, it is chargeable with
newspaper postage only; provided that the sheets in the aggregate do not
exceed 1,900 square inches.</p>

<p>"A pamphlet is a small, unbound, printed book."</p>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
